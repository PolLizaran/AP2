# AP2
## Data Science & Engineering 20/21 - Programming 2

This folder contains all the programs done during the subject 'Algorísmia i Programació II' at 'Grau en Ciència i Enginyeria de Dades - UPC'.

You can find from programs of containers and tree structures, to programs using graphs and divide and conquer strategies. In general, they are more complex than the ones in the folder AP1, as they're based on more advanced Data Algorithms to handle bigger and trickier problems.
